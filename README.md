# GitHub Activity CLI

Made for https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity

In this project, you will build a simple command line interface (CLI) to fetch the recent activity
of a GitHub user and display it in the terminal.

## How to Build and Run

1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/github-activity.git
cd github-activity-fetcher
```

2. Build the Project
```bash
go build -o github-activity
```

3. Run the CLI
```bash
./github-activity <username>
```

Replace `<username>` with the username of the GitHub user whose activity you want to fetch.
